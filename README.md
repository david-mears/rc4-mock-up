## To use the admin side of the site

```
python3.6 manage.py createsuperuser
```

Define the required details for the admin account. Anyone who can edit the source code of the website and deploy can create an admin account in this way.

Admin app (url: /admin) is where you can add new charities (e.g. RC Forward) or update their details (e.g. signature). Receipt Generator app (url: /) is where you go to create receipts.
